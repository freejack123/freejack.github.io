    <p>Basketball was used as an escape route to better myself, to remove myself from the riggers of the urban life of Dallas.  As a child I never found a way to compliment my personality with people my age. We all had nothing in common other than basketball.  I never really liked the game I just liked the opportunities it presented.

    <p>I was raised with 4 other siblings, 3 older brothers and 1 older sister.  I was the youngest (wow did that suck).  Imagine wearing all of your brothers hand-me-downs. Keep in mind this was handed down times 3.  Enough of that, lets get into why I like coding.</p>
    
    <p>I have always enjoyed build things. The ability to put things together was always intriguing to me. I can look at my work progress daily due to my passion for coding. You truly have to have a passion and a lot of drive to figure out issues.</p>
